# Spotify Playlist Manager

This project is a React web application that integrates with the Spotify API to allow users to search for tracks, manage playlists, and perform operations like adding and deleting tracks.

## Features

- **Login with Spotify:** Authenticate with your Spotify account using an access token.
- **Search for Songs:** Search for tracks on Spotify using the search bar.
- **Manage Playlists:** View your Spotify playlists in a sidebar, and select one to view its tracks.
- **Add/Remove Tracks:** Add tracks to your selected playlist or remove tracks from it.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.

## Components

### 1. **Login**

- Handles Spotify authentication via OAuth.
- Redirects the user to the login page if they are not authenticated.

### 2. **SearchBar**

- Allows the user to search for tracks via the Spotify API.
- Displays the current logged-in user's Spotify username.
- Contains a logout button to clear the token and log out.

### 3. **Sidebar**

- Displays the user's playlists and their tracks.
- Allows the user to switch between playlists and view their contents.
- Provides the option to delete tracks from a selected playlist.

### 4. **SearchResults**

- Displays search results in a list with track name, artist, and album image.
- Allows the user to add a track to the selected playlist.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-playlist-manager.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd spotify-playlist-manager
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   You will need to register an app with Spotify to get a client ID and redirect URI. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Login to Spotify:**

   The app will redirect you to Spotifyâ€™s login page. Once logged in, you can start using the app.

## Usage

1. **Login**: On the homepage, log in using your Spotify account. The app will store your access token in local storage.
2. **Search for Tracks**: Use the search bar at the top of the page to find tracks on Spotify.
3. **Manage Playlists**: View your playlists in the sidebar and select one to manage.
4. **Add/Delete Tracks**: Add a track to your selected playlist or remove a track from it.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Spotify Web API**: For fetching user data, playlists, tracks, and performing playlist modifications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for handling state and API interactions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Track Preview**: Add the ability to preview a song before adding it to a playlist.
- **Playlist Creation**: Allow users to create new playlists directly from the app.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for failed API requests.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
