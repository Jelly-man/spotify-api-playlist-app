## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-playlist-manager.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   You will need to register an app with Spotify to get a client ID and redirect URI. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Login to Spotify:**

   The app will redirect you to Spotifyâ€™s login page. Once logged in, you can start using the app.

## Usage

1. **Login**: On the homepage, log in using your Spotify account. The app will store your access token in local storage.
2. **Search for Tracks**: Use the search bar at the top of the page to find tracks on Spotify.
3. **Manage Playlists**: View your playlists in the sidebar and select one to manage.
4. **Add/Delete Tracks**: Add a track to your selected playlist or remove a track from it.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Spotify Web API**: For fetching user data, playlists, tracks, and performing playlist modifications.
